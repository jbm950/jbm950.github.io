Today is Friday the 10th and thus marks the end of the third week of Google
Summer of Code. This week started off with continuing work on making test code
and a base class for `KanesMethod` and `LagrangesMethod`. The work took a turn
early in the week when I started working on an example problem that would use
the base class instead of working on the base class and test code itself. This
resulted in more reading and studying of code examples. This week I also had
the opportunity to review multiple shorter PR's in addition to a longer one
that dealt directly with code in `KanesMethod`.

At the very beginning of this week I migrated all property attributes from
`KanesMethod` and `LagrangesMethod` into `EOM` as a base class. This work shows
up in [PR #11182](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11182) which was
originally meant to just be a discussion on the API for the base class. It was
suggested to me to stop working on the actual implementation at this point and
work on planning out a more complete API.

In order to come up with a more complete plan for the API for `EOM` I first had
to get a better understanding of what was done with the equations of motion
after the formation step. To do this I looked over
[pydy-tutorial-human-standing](https://github.com/pydy/pydy-tutorial-human-standing),
[Planar Pendulum
Example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bmcage/odes/blob/master/docs/ipython/Planar%20Pendulum%20as%20DAE.ipynb),
[Double Pendulum Example](http://www.pydy.org/examples/double_pendulum.html)
and [PyDy Mass Spring Damper
Example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pydy/pydy/blob/master/examples/mass_spring_damper/mass_spring_damper.ipynb).
After the equations of motion are formed the most common use for them was for
time simulations using ODE integration (or DAE integration) and so the next
thing I did was look into the documentation for the integrators
([scipy.integrate.odeint](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html#scipy.integrate.odeint)
and [scikit.odes.dae](https://github.com/bmcage/odes)). With this information I
was able to begin work on an example problem in for the PyDy repository that
would make use of this new class.

I found that Pydy's `System` class performed the work of rearrangeing the
equations of motion into a form accepted by the integrators and so the main
focus of the base class is to have the attributes that system expects. After
analyzing `System`'s internals I went ahead and created a basic example of a
base class and submitted the code in [PR
#353](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/pull/353) in the PyDy repository. The PR
shows manual entry of the equation of motion for a system with two masses,
springs and dampers and will be used for further discussion of the API.

This week I reviewed two shorter PR's and one longer PR. The shorter PR's were
[PR #10698](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10698) and [PR
#10693](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/10693) and covered sympy
documentation. The first requested removing a docstring of one of the modules
because the module had detailed documentation online. I suggested that this
would be a negative change to sympy overall and others in sympy came to the
same conclusion and it was promptly closed. The other documentation PR had a
couple of spelling fixes but also had some negative or non-useful changes and
is currently awaiting the author to remedy the latter. The Longer PR this week
was a continuation on the Kanes Method [PR
#11183](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11183) Jason started last week and
is an effort to improve the readibility and overall cleanliness of
`KanesMethod`.

### Future Directions

The current plan for the next steps of the project is to come up with a few
more examples of the base class in use. Once the example code has laid out an
API I will begin implementing the base class itself.
