I am excited to announce that I have been accepted for the the Google Summer of
Code program for the summer of 2016. I will be working with the Sympy open
source project's equation of motion generators. For the project I will mainly
be focusing on creating a shared base class for the current equation of motion
generators and adding an additional generator.
