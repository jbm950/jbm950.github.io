This week the focus was on the support code for the featherstone method.
I finished adding examples to the docstrings of every function I made. I
then wrote up test code for all of the new functions primarily focusing
on expected outputs but included some expected error messages for one of
the functions. Lastly I have coded up the functions themselves. This
work can be seen in [PR
#11331](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/11331).

I continued following the PR I reviewed last week and give suggestions
as he worked on it. The PR is now in my opinion ready to be merged and
is a beneficial addition to the sympy codebase.

The last thing I did this week was have a meeting about the presentation
that I will be aiding in on Monday. After the meeting I have spent some
time looking over my portions of the presentation and making sure I am
prepared to speak.

### Future Directions

Next week is the SciPy conference were I will be aiding in PyDy's
tutorial. Also I will be meeting with my mentor in person and during our
time there I suspect we will work on a variety of things from
Featherstone's articulated body method to the base class.
