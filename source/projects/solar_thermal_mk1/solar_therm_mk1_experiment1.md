# Solar Thermal Collector Mk1 Experiment 1 Page

[Link to Solar Thermal General Notes Page](./solar_thermal_mk1.html)

### Objective

The goal of this experiment is to practice setting up and running an experiment
on my own in addition to trying to tie experimental results to theoretical
learning

### Applicable Theory

(Collection of equations)

(Energy Harvested) => $\dot{Q}_{c} = \dot{m}c_{p}(T_{f,o} - T_{f,i})$ 

Need to do energy balances for control volumes to come up with some applicable
theory
