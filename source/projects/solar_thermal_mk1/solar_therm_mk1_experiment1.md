# Solar Thermal Collector Mk1 Experiment 1 Page

[Link to Solar Thermal General Notes Page](./solar_thermal_mk1.html)

### Objective

The goal of this experiment is to practice setting up and running an experiment
on my own in addition to trying to tie experimental results to theoretical
learning

### Applicable Theory

(Collection of equations)

(Energy Harvested) => $\dot{Q}_{c} = \dot{m}c_{p}(T_{f,o} - T_{f,i})$ 

Need to do energy balances for control volumes to come up with some applicable
theory

$m_{tank}c\frac{dT}{dt} = -\dot{W}_{pump} + \dot{m}c(T_{in} - T_{tank})$

> - Measurements
> - Use half of bucket
> - Trig to find height
> - Cylinder with radius halfway between top and bottom
>       - Trig find distance between vertical and edge to determine radius
> - Volume calculation

### Procedure

Will need a control test where just the bucket is used for the experiment

Collect

> _At beginning_

> - Voltage of batteries
> - Make sure the water hits a specific line on the bucket (same volume)

> _During_ (5 min intervals)

> - Water temp in bucket
> - Current air temp 

> _End_

> - Voltage of batteries
