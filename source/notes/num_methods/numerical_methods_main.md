Discrete - Solution obtained for specific locations in space and time and
not inbetween (grid/mesh, finite elements)

Every solution in this course is wrong by definition (approximations),
and so we need to know how wrong the solutions are (error analysis is
very important)

Every method has its setbacks, no method is optimal for all situations

Accuracy, efficiency, and stability are used as measuring points for the
different methods
