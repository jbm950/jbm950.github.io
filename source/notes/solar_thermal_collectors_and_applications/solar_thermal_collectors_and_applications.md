## 2. Solar Collectors {#solarcollectors}

> Solar collector = device absorbs incoming solar radiation, converts it to
  heat and passes it along to a fluid (ex. water, air, oil)

> - 2 Types of solar collectors
>     - Non-Concentrating/Stationary
>     - Concentrating

> - Solar collectors can be differentiated main by the following
    (distinguished by their motion)
>     - Stationary
>     - Single axis tracking
>     - Two-axes tracking
>     - operating temperature

> ### Stationary Collectors {#stationarycollectors}

> - Three main types of stationary collectors
>       - Flat plate collectors (FPC)
>       - Stationary Compound Parabolic Collectors (CPC)
>       - Evacuated Tube Collectors (ETC)

> - FPC (Flat Plate Collectors)
>       - Transparent plate
>           - Transparent to short wave radiation but opaque to longer wave
              lengths (greenhouse effect)
>       - Absorber plate
>           - Dark plate that absorbs the incoming radiation to heat up the
              fluid in pipes attached to the plate underneath
>       - Glazing = one or more sheets of material on top of the collector (the
          transparent cover)
>           - Glass is widely used
>               - can transmit up to 90% shortwave radiation and virtually no
                  long wave radiation
>           - Plastic films/sheets can be used as well
>               - Can have good short wave transmittance but tend to also a
                  higher long wave transmittance
>               - Also limited structuarlly by temperatures, UV radiation
>               - More resistant to hail and stones
>               - Generally lower mass than the glass glazings
>       - Absorber Plate
>           - Absorptance of shortwave radiation debends on nature and color of
              the coating and the incident angle
>           - Typical selective surface
>               - Thin upper layer
>                   - highly absorptive shortwave
>                   - Relatively transparent longwave
>               - Surface
>                   - High reflectance
>                   - Low emittance longwave
>           - Absorpers based on two layers with different optical properties
              are called tandem absorbers
>           - These two layer materials are made using nano-material creation
              techniques
>               - ex. Sputtering, electroplating
>           - It is difficult to create a good thermal bond cheaply between the
              absorption plate and the fluid channels
>               - Avoid soft solder due to hight plate temperatures

> - CPC (Compound Parabolic Collectors)
>       - Concentrate radiation using two sections of parabolic mirrors facing
          each other
>       - Usually covered with glass to avoid dust from entering the collector
          and reducing the reflectivity of the walls
>       - Acceptance angle = angle at which a source of light can be moved and
          still converge at the absorber
>       - Collector can be stationary or tracking
>           - If long axis oriented North-South collector must track the sun
>       - Smaller concentration ratios (< 3) of greater practical interest
>           - Can accept large amount of diffuse radiation and concentrate it
              without the need for tracking
>       - Two basic types of CPC collectors
>           - Symmetric
>           - Asymmetric
>       - Employ two main types of absorbers
>           - fin type with pipe
>           - tubular
>       - Some practical design consideration
>           - Choice of reciever type
>           - Method to introduce gap between reciever and reflector
>           - Effect of glass envelope around reciever

> - ETC (Evacuated Tube Collectors)
>       - Conventional flat plate collectors lose benefits in cold, cloudy and
          windy days and are succeptible to weather influences
>       - Vacuum envelope reduces convection and conduction heat loss
>       - ETC efficiency higher than FPC at low incident angles
>           - ETC advantage in day long performance
>       - Has a heat pipe in a vacuum sealed tube
>       - Utilizeds an evaporation-condensation cycle
>       - No evaporation or condensation possible above the phase change
          temperature
>           - Protection from freezing and overheating
>           - Built in self limiting temperature control unique compared to the
              other two methods
>       - Dewar tubes
>           - Two concentric glass tubes with a vacuum space between them
>       - Integrated Compound Parabolic Collector (ICPC)
>           - Combination of CPC and ETC where the ETC is used as the reciever
              for a CPC system

> ### Sun tracking concentrating collectors {#sun_tracking_collectors}

> - By concentrating the solar energy, on can reduce the surface area over
    which heat loss occurs
>       - Results in higher possible temperatures

> - Concentrating Advantages
>       - Higher temperatures thus higher efficiencies
>       - Able to achieve a thermodynamic match between temperature level and
          required temperature level
>       - Higher thermal efficiency
>       - Requires less material and is structurally simpler than FPC
>           - Can result in lower cost per unit area
> - Concentrating Disadvantages
>       - Collect little diffuse radiation depending on concentration ratio
>       - Tracking system required to follow the sun
>       - Reflector surfaces may lose reflectance over time and may require
          cleaning and refurbishing

> - Increase ratio of aperture to absorber area increases temperature bur
    requires higher precision

> - 2 Methods of tracking the sun's motion
>       - Altazimuth method
>       - One axis tracking

> - Can attach mirrors to a FPC and make it a concentrating collector
> - Another type of concentrating collector is CPC which can be tracking or
    stationary
> - Trouble collectiong diffuse component of radiation
> - Concentration can be obtained by reflection or refraction by use of mirrors
    or lenses
> - Concentrating collectors can be characterized as imaging or non-imaging
>       - Is the image of the sun focused at the reciever or not?

> - Imaging Collector Categories
>       - Parabolic trough collector
>       - Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR)
>       - Parabolic Dish
>       - Central Reciever

> - Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTC)
>       - Can effectively produce heat at temps 50-400 deg C
>       - Parabolic reflective material directs light at a metal black tube at
          the focal point which is covered by a glass tube to reduce heat loss
>       - N-S oriented have highest cosine loss at noon and lowest in the
          morning and evening
>           - E-W oriented has the opposite effect
>           - Choice of orientation depends on application and if more energy
              is needed in summer or winter
>       - PTC's are most mature solar technology to generate temp up to 400 deg
          C
>       - Reciever typically has a selective coating
>       - Disadvantage of glass tube is transmittance loss of the concentrated
          light
>           - Can reduce loss with anti reflective coating
