## Exam 2 Review

> ## Characterization of Nanomaterials

>> ### Contrast Enhancement

>>> #### Brightfield  

>>> - Sensors placed parallel to direct beam  
>>> - Makes background brighter than object  

>>> #### Darkfield

>>> - Sensor place at an angle/offset from direct beam
>>> - Makes object brighter than background

>> ### Microscope Resolution

>> - White light resolution ~ 300nm
>> - Numerical Aperture (NA) ~ 1.2-1.5 for and optical microscope
>> - Wavelength $\downarrow$  $\Rightarrow$ resolution $\uparrow$

>> ### Electron-Specimen Interaction

>> - BSE and SE come off top of specimen
>> - Scattered and unscattered electrons transmit through specimen
>> - X-rays off top of specimen

>>> #### Back Scattered Electrons (BSE)

>>> - Scattering angle > 180$^{\circ}$
>>> - Atomic number $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ BSE $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$
      brighter image

>>> #### Secondary Electrons (SE)

>>> - Collision between incoming electrons and loosely bonded electrons

>> ### Electron Microscope

>>> #### Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

>>> - Collects BSE and SE
>>> - Provides morphology information

>>>> #### Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS)

>>>> - X-rays emitted during SEM
>>>> - Provides element information (element mapping)

>>> #### Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)

>>> - Collects BSE and SE like SEM but also collects transmitted electrons
>>> - Provides crystal structure in addition to the information SEM provides

>> ### X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)

>> - Kinetic energy of electrons to reveal binding energies
>> - Determines elements by binding energies
>> - Can differentiate between isotopes

>> ### X-Ray Diffractometer (XRE)

>> - Detects phase shifts in x-rays through a material
>> - Provides information on crystal structures (bond length, bond angle, atom 
     positions)

>> ### Scanning Probe Microscopy

>>> #### Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

>>> - Drags a probe across the tops of a specimen
>>> - Measures tomography and some mechanical properties

>>> #### Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)

>>> - Measures electric current between a probe and the specimen
>>> - Provides surface information

> ## Nano Composites

>> ### Polymer vs. Ceramic vs. Metal

>>> - Ceramic = high strength, low toughness
>>> - Polymer = high toughness, low strength
>>> - Metal = medium strength, medium toughness

>> ### What Are Composites

>>> - Consists of a matrix material base and added reinforcement material
>>> - Create new and improved properties from the combination of materials

>> ### Polymer/Nano Clay

>>> #### Phase Separated (Microcomposites)

>>> - Polymer is unable to enter silicate
>>> - Poor mixing leaves regions properties largely dependant on single 
       materials

>>> #### Intercalated (Nanocomposite)

>>> - Single polymer inbetween silicate layers
>>> - Overall material properties starting to not have localized zones 

>>> #### Exfoliated/Delaminated

>>> - Silicate layers are dispersed in polymer matrix (complete mixing)
>>> - Properties are very different even compared to the microcomposite


>> ### XRE of Possible Polymer/Nano Clay Samples

>>> $d = \frac{\lambda}{2\sin{\theta}}$

>>> d - Distance bewteen layers  
>>> $\lambda$ - Wave length  
>>> $\theta$ - Phase angle

>>> $\theta$ $\uparrow$ $\Rightarrow$ d $\downarrow$

>>>> A = Phase Separated  
>>>> B = Partially Exfoliated  
>>>> C = Fully Exfoliated  
>>>> D = Intercalated
