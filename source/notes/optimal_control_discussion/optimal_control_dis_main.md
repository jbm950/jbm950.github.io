## Minimum Principle {#minimum_principle}

- The most general form of finding a minimum value for a function $f(x)$ can be
  stated as $x^{*} = arg (min_{x \in [a,b]}) f(x)$
    - $min_{x \in [a,b]} f(x)$ will return the minimum value of $f(x)$ over the
      input interval [a, b]
    - $arg$ will find the input value that resulted in the minimum $f(x)$ value
- The minimum principle can be used to determine the optimal solution, $x^{*}$,
  to the function $f(x)$
- This form is more general of a condition than that provided by the first and
  second derivative tests
- This would be considered direct optimization because the function $f(x)$ is
  actually evaluated when finding the optimal input
