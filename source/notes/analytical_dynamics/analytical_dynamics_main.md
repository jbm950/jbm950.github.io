## Vectors {#vectors}

- Vectors are quantities in $E^{3}$ (3D Euclidian Space) that have both
  magnitude and direction
- Magnitude is defined as $|| \underline{b} || = \sqrt{b \cdot b}$
- Direction of the vector is defined by its unit vector $\underline{u}_{b} = \frac{\underline{b}}{|| \underline{b} ||}$

## Reference Frames {#reference_frames}

- A reference frame is any set of at least 3 non-colinear points whose mutual
  distances are constant
- A reference frame is a rigid body
- Deciding reference frames allows for the formulation of problems

## Coordinate System {#coordinate_system}

- Coordinate systems are a set of three linearly independent vectors
  {$\underline{e_{1}}, \underline{e_{2}}, \underline{e_{3}}$} in $E^{3}$
  (3D Euclidian Space)
- There are three main conviences that are made when creating a coordinate
  system
    1. Have all three vectors {$\underline{e_{1}}, \underline{e_{2}},
       \underline{e_{3}}$} be mutuall orthogonal
    2. Have all three vectors {$\underline{e_{1}}, \underline{e_{2}},
       \underline{e_{3}}$} be unit vectors
    3. Create a right handed system
- Coordinate systems are built on reference frames to allow measurement within
  the frame or allow a problem to be implemented
    - The coordinate system moves with its reference frame
    - Coordinate systems must be fixed with only one reference frame whereas
      each reference frame can have infinite coordinate systems
- Bigger problems come from mistakes in the formulation of the problem
  (deciding reference frames) than mistakes in the implementation of the
  problem (deciding and using the coordinate systems)
