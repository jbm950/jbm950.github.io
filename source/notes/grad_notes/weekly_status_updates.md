# Weekly Status Updates

### Week 8/21/2015 - 8/28/2015

This week I started by taking general optimal control notes from the article
_Faster, Higher and Greener_ to better understand controls terminology. I also
took some general notes over the control Hamiltonian and Calculus of
Variations. For the calculus of variations notes I found an article,
_Introduction to the Calculus of Variations_, of which I read a portion. A lot
of the articles I was finding about the calculus of variations spent more time
with examples of its usage rather than defining the concept itself. I also
began taking some notes on the article _An Efficient Overloaded Method for
Computing Derivatives of Mathematical Functions in MATLAB_ to get a base of
knowledge on computational derivatives. To further gain information on
automatic derivatives I found the site <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/"
target="_blank">www.autodiff.org</a> that is a central hub for automatic
differentiation information. The site contains lists of articles and books that
have dealt with the topic of automatic differentiation along with links to
different tools that use automatic differentiation in different programming
languages. From this web site I have found the article _An Introduction to
Automatic Differentiation_ from which I plan to read and take notes over.

> #### Future Directions

> - I plan to finish reading and taking notes over _An Introduction to
    Automatic Differentiation_
> - I will then continue learning about automatic differentiation, using the
    site <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/"
    target="_blank">www.autodiff.org</a> as a guide
