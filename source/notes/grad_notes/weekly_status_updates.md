# Weekly Status Updates

### Week 9/19/2015 - 9/25/2015

This week I started off continuing notes in chapter 2 section 3 but I then
jumped to chapter 4 which covers optimality conditions at the recommendation of
Dr. Rao. I have read chapter 4 section 1 which deals with optimality conditions
of unconstrained problems. I have spent the rest of the time this week going
back through chapter 4 section 1 taking notes and trying to improve my
understanding of its content. One problem that I have been encountering is that
the chapter keeps refering back to chapter 3 theorems and material that I have
not yet learned, however, I am making progress on understanding the optimality
conditions and should be able to move forward to the next section soon.

### Week 9/12/2015 - 9/18/2015

This week I continued making progress through the book _Nonlinear Programming:
Theory and Algorithms_ by Bazaraa. I was able to finish taking notes over
chapter 2 section 1 which covered convex sets and convex hulls. I have also
completely read and taken notes over chapter 2 section 2. This section had a
multitude of set definitions in it including neighborhood of a point, set
closure, interior of a set, set boundaries and compact sets. I have also spent
some time reading the mathematical review of sets and sequences presented in
appendix A.3 of the book in order to further my understanding of chapter 2
section 2. I have read chapter 2 section 3 and am currently in the process of
taking notes over that section, however, I have had to spend more time in the
mathematical review in the appendix in order to aid in comprehension of the
chapter 2 section 3 material.

### Week 9/5/2015 - 9/11/2015

This week time was spent exclusively working with the book _Nonlinear
Programming: Theory and Algorithms_ by Bazaraa. Over the course of the week I
have completely read chapter 1 of this book which deals with the format of
nonlinear programming problems and have taken notes over that chapter.  I have
also read through chapter 2 section 1 which covers convex sets and convex hulls
and am currently taking notes over this section.

### Week 8/29/2015 - 9/4/2015

This week I started off reading the article _An Introduction to Automatic
Differentiation_. After I finished reading the article I went back and started
to take notes over the details of the article in order to gain a better
understanding. During this note taking I differentiated a fucntion I made up
using the automatic differentiation method described in the article. Also while
taking notes I added information on Hessian matrices to my general notes page.
About part way through the week Dr. Rao mentioned that I could maybe do a
project involving writing a new non-linear programming problem solver and so I
did a bit of research on NLP solvers. While serching for information I found
more comparisons of current NLP solvers than research articles involving what a
NLP solver is and how they are improved. Dr. Rao then lent me 3 text books to
start reading: _Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms_ by Bazaraa,
_Practical Methods of Optimization_ by Fletcher and _Nonlinear Programming_ by
Bertsekas. I have begun reading and taking notes over _Nonlinear Programming:
Theory and Algorithms_ and plan to continue doing so for the forseeable future.

> #### Future Directions

> - I plan to read and take notes over the three textbooks given to me over
    nonlinear programming which I believe will take a significant amount of
    time

### Week 8/21/2015 - 8/28/2015

This week I started by taking general optimal control notes from the article
_Faster, Higher and Greener_ to better understand controls terminology. I also
took some general notes over the control Hamiltonian and Calculus of
Variations. For the calculus of variations notes I found an article,
_Introduction to the Calculus of Variations_, of which I read a portion. A lot
of the articles I was finding about the calculus of variations spent more time
with examples of its usage rather than defining the concept itself. I also
began taking some notes on the article _An Efficient Overloaded Method for
Computing Derivatives of Mathematical Functions in MATLAB_ to get a base of
knowledge on computational derivatives. To further gain information on
automatic derivatives I found the site <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/"
target="_blank">www.autodiff.org</a> that is a central hub for automatic
differentiation information. The site contains lists of articles and books that
have dealt with the topic of automatic differentiation along with links to
different tools that use automatic differentiation in different programming
languages. From this web site I have found the article _An Introduction to
Automatic Differentiation_ from which I plan to read and take notes over.

    Automatic Differentiation_

    site <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/"
