## Banking {#banking}

> ### Choose a Bank

>> - Look for banks that participate in the Federal Deposit Insurance
     Corporation (FDIC). Need to verify participation on FDIC's [Bank
     Find](https://research.fdic.gov/bankfind/)
>> - What is the process and options for withdrawing money
>> - Look up the reputation of the bank for its services if possible
>> - Look for "account terms" or "disclosures" or _Truth in Savings Disclosure_
     for information on accounts

>> #### Physical Banks

>>> __Small Town Bank__

>>> - Probably limited hours and ATM fees for ATMs that do not belong to that
      branch 
>>> - Lower overhead can lead to better terms on accounts

>>> __Large Chain Bank__

>>> - Probably large extensive ATM network with fewer fees but not as
      competitive terms on checking and savings accounts bc of the overhead of
      additional branches and ATMs.

>> #### Online Banks

>>> - Lowered cost of business (no branches to maintain) can lead to better
      account terms.
>>> - Convienent to access without having to go into bank. (Physical banks may
      offer online services too and so this may be a moot point)

>> #### Alternative Banking

>>> __Credit Union__

>>> - Due to income tax exemptions Credit Unions can sometimes offer good deals
      on accounts
>>> - Not necessarily available for everyone.
>>> - Find local credit unions [here](http://www.asmarterchoice.org/)

> ### Account types

>> #### Checking Account

>> - Generally earning low to no interest
>> - Easy to use for transactions
>> - Have to give permission in advance for overdraft protection

>> #### Credit Card

>> - Avoid like the plague

>> #### Savings Account

>> - Higher interest earnings than checking accounts but historically less than
     money market funds (see [Investing](#investing))
>>      - Good banks now can offer competitive rates on savings accounts
>> - Easier access to money than other options

> ### Food

>> - Learn to cook and eat leftovers
>> - Use store brands instead of name brands. The extra price for name brands
    is often advertising costs rather than food quality improvements.
    Sometimes the store brand is even the same product/recipe as the name
    brand.
>> - Buy in bulk but be careful with spoilable items
>>      - Split the order with a friend to obtain the better price but not
        worry about food spoiling
>> - Using a slow cooker can cut down costs
>>      - Avoid having to eat out on a busy night with a little prep time in
          the morning
>>      - Saves cooking time on non-busy nights too
>>      - Use less energy than stovetop or oven

>> #### Eating Out

>> - Eat our for breakfast or lunch so that you can spend less for smaller
     portions

> ### Reduce Taxes
