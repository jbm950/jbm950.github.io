## Banking {#banking}

> ### Choose a Bank

>> - Look for banks that participate in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
     (FDIC). Need to verify participation on FDIC's [Bank
     Find](https://research.fdic.gov/bankfind/)
>> - What is the process and options for withdrawing money
>> - Look up the reputation of the bank for its services if possible
>> - Look for "account terms" or "disclosures" or _Truth in Savings Disclosure_
     for information on accounts

>> #### Physical Banks

>>> __Small Town Bank__

>>> - Probably limited hours and ATM fees for ATMs that do not belong to that
      branch 
>>> - Lower overhead can lead to better terms on accounts

>>> __Large Chain Bank__

>>> - Probably large extensive ATM network with fewer fees but not as
      competitive terms on checking and savings accounts bc of the overhead of
      additional branches and ATMs.

>> #### Online Banks

>>> - Lowered cost of business (no branches to maintain) can lead to better
      account terms.
>>> - Convienent to access without having to go into bank. (Physical banks may
      offer online services too and so this may be a moot point)

>> #### Alternative Banking

>>> __Credit Union__

>>> - Due to income tax exemptions Credit Unions can sometimes offer good deals on accounts
>>> - Not necessarily available for everyone.
>>> - Find local credit unions [here](http://www.asmarterchoice.org/)
