# Control Theory
**Taught by: Dr. John Conklin**  
**Taken: SS 2016**  

## Table of Contents

Dynamical Systems 
- behavior at present depends on input forces applied in the past and initial
  conditions (system with memory)

Class will focus on Linear Constant Coefficient Ordinary Differential Equations
(LCCODE's)

Guidance, Navigation and Control are three separate topics

Sometimes the focus of the work should be on changing the plant rather than
implementing more complex control logic
