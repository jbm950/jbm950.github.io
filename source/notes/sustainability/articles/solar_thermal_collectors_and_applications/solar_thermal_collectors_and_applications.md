## 1. Introduction

> ### History of Solar Energy {#history}

> - August Monchot - 19th century
>       - Solar powered steam engines
>       - Made an advance by making one solar device a truncated cone reflector

> - Abel Pifre - Contemporary of Monchot
>       - Used parabolic reflectors with very small mirrors

> - A.G. Eneas
>       - 1901 focusing collector powered water pumping aparatus at a farm in
          California

> - Father Himalaya
>       - 1904 Large solar furnace
>           - Exhibited at St. Louis world fair
>           - Large, off axis, parabolic horn collector

> Shuman + CV Boys
>       - 1912 Meadi Egypt worlds largest pumping plant
>           - Parabolic long cylindars fcus sunlight into long absorbing tube
>           - Shut down in 1915 due to onset of WWI and cheaper fuel prices

> - Two main types of solar thermal collectors
>       - Central reciever
>           - Ex. Tower with helio stats (mirrors)
>       - Distributed reciever
>           - Ex. Parabolic trough
