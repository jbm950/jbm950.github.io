# Dynamics Notes

This will be the localized place for all future dynamics notes, however,
much of my dynamics notes are currently located on the notes page for my
[analytical dynamics
class](../analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html).

## Mass Matrix {#mass_matrix}

The formal definition for a mass matrix M is 

$T = \frac{1}{2} \dot{q}^{T} M \dot{q}$

where

- $T$ is the kinetic energy of the system
- $\dot{q}$ is first time derivative of the generalized coordinate vector q 

## Nonholonomic system {#nonholonomic_system}

A nonholonomic system is a system whose state depends on the path taken in
order to achieve it. (Path dependent system)

A constraint which does not reduce the degrees of freedom (Knowing one
generalized coordinate and the constraint allows solving for the other
coordinate is a holonomic system, ie two points connected by a massless rod)
