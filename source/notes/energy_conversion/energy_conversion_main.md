### 1.1 Forms of Energy

- Useful Energy - In general it can be viewed as the source of ability to make
  "changes" on an object with mass
    - "changes" - making movements/dynamic motion in space with time for the
      object
    - ex. work = force $\times$ distance traveled in the direction of the force
      = ($N \cdot m = J$)
    - distance traveled = "changes"/movement with time

#### Kinetic Energy vs. Potential Energy (KE vs. PE)

> __Definition of Kinetic Energy__

> - Macroscale - A copper ball with mass $m_{ball}$ and velocity
    $^{N}\underline{V}_{ball}$ 
>       - (Where N is an inertial reference frame fixed w/ the Earth's surface)
>       - $KE_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} m_{ball} | ^{N}\underline{V}_{ball} | \,
          \cdot \, | ^{N}\underline{V}_{ball} |$

> - Microscale - The atoms making up the copper ball with mass, $m_{atom}$, and
    velocity, $^{R}\underline{V}_{atom}$ 
>       - (Where R is the reference frame fixed on the ball)
>       - $KE_{atom} = \frac{1}{2} m_{atom} | ^{R}\underline{V}_{atom} | \,
          \cdot \, | ^{R}\underline{V}_{atom} |$

> - For $n$ atoms in the ball
>       - $v_{rms} = \left(\sum^{N}_{i=1} | ^{R}\underline{V}_{atom} |^{2} /
          N\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$
>           - Represents average speed of the atoms in the ball
>       - $\frac{3}{2} k T_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} m_{atom} v_{rms}^{2}$
>           - Where the left hand side represents the thermal energy of the
              system

> __Definition of Potential Energy__

> - Macroscale - Must have a force field present. A suspended ball of mass
    $m_{ball}$ a distance $x$ above the ground in a gravity field
>       - $PE_{ball} = m_{ball}gx$ where $g= | \underline{g} |$

>> - If the force field is conservative (in a vacuum) the energy is conserved
>>      - $PE + KE = const$
>>      - $\Delta PE + \Delta KE = 0$

> - Microscale - For a molecule, $O_{2}$, ($O=O$) there is energy stored as an
    attractive force in the double bond (acts like a spring)
>       - $PE = \frac{1}{2} k x^{2}$ where $x$ is the displacement from a zero
          spring force position (modeling the bond as a spring)
>       - Breaking the bonds releases the potential energy as kinetic energy
          ($PE \right KE$)

#### Total Energy and Break Down of Internal Energy

> - Total energy in a system with mass $M_{0}$ and volume $V$ is represented as
    follows
>       - Total Energy (E) = Internal Energy (IE) + Kinetic Energy (KE) +
          Potential Energy (PE)
>       - Generally:
>           - KE = macroscopic kinetic energy
>           - PE = macroscopic potential energy
>           - IE = sum of the microscopic forms of energy carried by its
              elementary constituents (atoms and molecules)
> - Internal Energy = Thermal Energy (TE) + Chemical Energy (ChE) + Nuclear
    Energy (NE) + Electical Energy (EE)
>       - TE = Sensible heat + Latent heat
>           - Sensible heat = sum of KE of all atoms and molecules measured by
              absolute temperature
>           - Latent heat = sum of the potential energy established by the
              forces among atoms and molecules
>       - ChE = Bonding energy between atoms in a molecule
>           - The energy to break a bond is equal to the amount of energy to
              re-establish the bond
>           - Bond energy between two elements is unique to those two elements
>       - NE = Binding energy among protons and neutrons
>       - EE = Energy of electrons (bound or free)
>           - Closer to the nucleus = more force
>           - shell $0 \right 1$ have to add energy
>           - shell $1 \right 0$ release energy (electromagnetic waves)
>       - Other forms:
>           - Electromagnetic Waves (Thermal Radiation/Solar Radiation)
