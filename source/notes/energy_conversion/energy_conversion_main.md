### 1.1 Forms of Energy

- Useful Energy - In general it can be viewed as the source of ability to make
  "changes" on an object with mass
    - "changes" - making movements/dynamic motion in space with time for the
      object
    - ex. work = force $\times$ distance traveled in the direction of the force
      = ($N \cdot m = J$)
    - distance traveled = "changes"/movement with time

#### Kinetic Energy vs. Potential Energy (KE vs. PE)

> __Definition of Kinetic Energy__

> - Macroscale - A copper ball with mass $m_{ball}$ and velocity
    $^{N}\underline{V}_{ball}$
>   (Where N is an inertial reference frame fixed w/ the Earth's surface)
>       - $KE_{ball} = \frac{1}{2} m_{ball} | ^{N}\underline{V}_{ball} | \,
          \cdot \, | ^{N}\underline{V}_{ball} |$
