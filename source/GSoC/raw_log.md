### This is a raw work log and not meant to be a detailed overview of progress

<hr>

## Pre-Week 2

### 5/12/2016

- Worked on implementing [Basic Equation of
  Motion](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#e_basic_equation_of_motion)
  in code
    - Got it to the point where it produces an equation of motion but it is not
      matching my handwritten result
- Finished reading [A Beginners Guide to 6-D Vectors (Part
  1)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5569032#article)
- Figured out how to get the run time for the testing code

### 5/11/2016

- Added a link to the timeline on my website so it was easier to access
- Worked out [Basic Equation of
  Motion](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#e_basic_equation_of_motion)
  using Langrange's Method by hand as a refresher

### 5/10/2016

- Created a [PR #349](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/pull/349) for a simple
  grammar error on the pydy example page
    - Jason merged it
- Began Reading [A Beginners Guide to 6-D Vectors (Part
  1)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5569032#article)
    - Made it to the beginning of section 6
- Decided on what examples I want to do to learn the equations of motion
  generation with sympy
    - [Basic Equation of Motion](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#e_basic_equation_of_motion)
    - [Basic System of Particles](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#basic_sys_of_particles)
