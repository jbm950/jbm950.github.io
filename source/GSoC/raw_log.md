## Pre-Week 3

### 5/18/2016

- Addressed Jasons comments on the simple pendulum example [PR
  #351](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/pull/351)
- Began email correspondance about the planning of weekly meetings
- Began looking up flight prices from Austin to Gainesville
    - Booked a flight
- Started work on a custom viewer for the benchmarking database using tkinter
    - Able to pull up the database, average all the data taken on a single day,
      and plot the data using matplotlib
- Started Roy Featherstones short course on spatial vector algebra
    - Made it to slide 32 in both the slides and slide notes and ended while
      working on questions A2

### 5/16/2016

- Asked for clarification about travel for scipy conference
- Watched a video on using sqlite with python
- Created a database for the benchmarking software
- Created code to run the main overhead for the benchmarking software that
  calls out individual tests
- Created a test to run Kanes Equations based on the example mass spring damper
  code in KanesMethod's docstring
- Created a test to run Lagranges Equations based on the simple pendulum
  example I added to pydy
- Fixed some errors in the physics documentation and created a [PR
  #11117](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/pull/351)
- Began Reading [A Beginners Guide to 6-D Vectors (Part
  2)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5663690)
- Fixed my adding of RSS feed to PSF GSoC collection of blogs
    - Had accidentally made the pull request between branches of my repository
      rather than my repository and the GSoC repository

## Pre-Week 2

### 5/13/2016

- Got pendulum example to match the hand derived results
- Drew a diagram (svg) for the pendulum example
- Created a [PR #351](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/pull/351) for the pendulum
  example in the examples folder of pydy
- Added RSS feed to PSF GSoC collection of blogs
- Started the benchmarking program

### 5/12/2016

- Worked on implementing [Basic Equation of
  Motion](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#e_basic_equation_of_motion)
  in code
    - Got it to the point where it produces an equation of motion but it is not
      matching my handwritten result
- Finished reading [A Beginners Guide to 6-D Vectors (Part
  1)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5569032#article)
- Figured out how to get the run time for the testing code

### 5/11/2016

- Added a link to the timeline on my website so it was easier to access
- Worked out [Basic Equation of
  Motion](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#e_basic_equation_of_motion)
  using Langrange's Method by hand as a refresher

### 5/10/2016

- Created a [PR #349](https://github.com/pydy/pydy/pull/349) for a simple
  grammar error on the pydy example page
    - Jason merged it
- Began Reading [A Beginners Guide to 6-D Vectors (Part
  1)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=5569032#article)
    - Made it to the beginning of section 6
- Decided on what examples I want to do to learn the equations of motion
  generation with sympy
    - [Basic Equation of Motion](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#e_basic_equation_of_motion)
    - [Basic System of Particles](../notes/analytical_dynamics/analytical_dynamics_main.html#basic_sys_of_particles)
