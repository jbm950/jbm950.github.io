## Write up of Meetings

## First meeting (5/6/2016)

- Required to review a pull request a week and mention it in the blog post
- Make sure that the pull requests over the summer are shorter to enable them
  to be added to the code base in a more timely fashion
- Angadh is the primary mentor and Thomas is the co-mentor
    - Jason is providing assistance when needed
- When typing on sympy page (issues, pull requests, etc) @sympy/mechanics
  should ping all of the people related to the project
- Look into implementing a Featherstone/Jain method instead of a Newton Euler
  method
    - Produces a lot more efficient EOM
    - Can learn the Featherstone method from his book/website/articles
- Look into implementation of some other dyamics software
    - Dart
    - Symbody
- I should set up a folder to put articles and relevant files for the project
  and share that folder with mentors
- I could work through an example from dynamics class using sympy/pydy and
  submit the worked example to the pydy examples folder for practice
- The base equations of motion generation class should be able to accept manual
  entry of the equations of motion such that it can interface with pydy
    - A functional rather than purely abstract base class
- Determine if I can make it to the scipy conference and what monatary
  assistance I may require
