<ul>
<li>Had a brief meeting with Angadh</li>
<li>Worked on adding filters to benchmarking viewer
<ul>
<li>Had to find the proper widget for this task</li>
<li>Figured out how to use tk.Menu</li>
<li>Found SQLite command for determining all the tables in a database</li>
<li>Got the matplotlib section of the GUI to be drawn over instead of trying to add additional graphs</li>
<li>Viewer can now update the graph based on switching tables and specifying specific python version or platform</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Changed the benchmark code for kane's method and lagrange's method
<ul>
<li>put the LagrangesMethod and form equations in a function (same for KanesMethod) and call the function from timeit rather than import the whole file</li>
<li>Needed to be run significantly fewer iterations to achieve the same run time</li>
</ul></li>
