<h2 id="write-up-of-meetings">Write up of Meetings</h2>
<h2 id="first-meeting-562016">First meeting (5/6/2016)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Required to review a pull request a week and mention it in the blog post</li>
<li>Make sure that the pull requests over the summer are shorter to enable them to be added to the code base in a more timely fashion</li>
<li>Angadh is the primary mentor and Thomas is the co-mentor
<ul>
<li>Jason is providing assistance when needed</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When typing on sympy page (issues, pull requests, etc) <span class="citation">@sympy/mechanics</span> should ping all of the people related to the project</li>
<li>Look into implementing a Featherstone/Jain method instead of a Newton Euler method
<ul>
<li>Produces a lot more efficient EOM</li>
<li>Can learn the Featherstone method from his book/website/articles</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look into implementation of some other dyamics software
<ul>
<li>Dart</li>
<li>Symbody</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I should set up a folder to put articles and relevant files for the project and share that folder with mentors</li>
<li>I could work through an example from dynamics class using sympy/pydy and submit the worked example to the pydy examples folder for practice</li>
<li>The base equations of motion generation class should be able to accept manual entry of the equations of motion such that it can interface with pydy
<ul>
<li>A functional rather than purely abstract base class</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Determine if I can make it to the scipy conference and what monatary assistance I may require</li>
</ul>
