<p>Discrete - Solution obtained for specific locations in space and time and not inbetween (grid/mesh, finite elements)</p>
<p>Every solution in this course is wrong by definition (approximations), and so we need to know how wrong the solutions are (error analysis is very important)</p>
<p>Every method has its setbacks, no method is optimal for all situations</p>
<p>Accuracy, efficiency, and stability are used as measuring points for the different methods</p>
