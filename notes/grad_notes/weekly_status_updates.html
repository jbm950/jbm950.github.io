<p>This week I continued making progress through the book <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> by Bazaraa. I was able to finish taking notes over chapter 2 section 1 which covered convex sets and convex hulls. I have also completely read and taken notes over chapter 2 section 2. This section had a multitude of set definitions in it including neighborhood of a point, set closure, interior of a set, set boundaries and compact sets. I have also spent some time reading the mathematical review of sets and sequences presented in appendix A.3 of the book in order to further my understanding of chapter 2 section 2. I have read chapter 2 section 3 and am currently in the process of taking notes over that section, however, I have had to spend more time in the mathematical review in the appendix in order to aid in comprehension of the chapter 2 section 3 material.</p>

<p>This week time was spent exclusively working with the book <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> by Bazaraa. Over the course of the week I have completely read chapter 1 of this book which deals with the format of nonlinear programming problems and have taken notes over that chapter. I have also read through chapter 2 section 1 which covers convex sets and convex hulls and am currently taking notes over this section.</p>

<p>This week I started off reading the article <em>An Introduction to Automatic Differentiation</em>. After I finished reading the article I went back and started to take notes over the details of the article in order to gain a better understanding. During this note taking I differentiated a fucntion I made up using the automatic differentiation method described in the article. Also while taking notes I added information on Hessian matrices to my general notes page. About part way through the week Dr. Rao mentioned that I could maybe do a project involving writing a new non-linear programming problem solver and so I did a bit of research on NLP solvers. While serching for information I found more comparisons of current NLP solvers than research articles involving what a NLP solver is and how they are improved. Dr. Rao then lent me 3 text books to start reading: <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> by Bazaraa, <em>Practical Methods of Optimization</em> by Fletcher and <em>Nonlinear Programming</em> by Bertsekas. I have begun reading and taking notes over <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> and plan to continue doing so for the forseeable future.</p>

<p>This week I started by taking general optimal control notes from the article <em>Faster, Higher and Greener</em> to better understand controls terminology. I also took some general notes over the control Hamiltonian and Calculus of Variations. For the calculus of variations notes I found an article, <em>Introduction to the Calculus of Variations</em>, of which I read a portion. A lot of the articles I was finding about the calculus of variations spent more time with examples of its usage rather than defining the concept itself. I also began taking some notes on the article <em>An Efficient Overloaded Method for Computing Derivatives of Mathematical Functions in MATLAB</em> to get a base of knowledge on computational derivatives. To further gain information on automatic derivatives I found the site <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/"
target="_blank">www.autodiff.org</a> that is a central hub for automatic differentiation information. The site contains lists of articles and books that have dealt with the topic of automatic differentiation along with links to different tools that use automatic differentiation in different programming languages. From this web site I have found the article <em>An Introduction to Automatic Differentiation</em> from which I plan to read and take notes over.</p>
