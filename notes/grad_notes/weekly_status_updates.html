<p>This week I started by taking general optimal control notes from the article <em>Faster, Higher and Greener</em> to better understand controls terminology. I also took some general notes over the control Hamiltonian and Calculus of Variations. For the calculus of variations notes I found an article, <em>Introduction to the Calculus of Variations</em>, of which I read a portion. A lot of the articles I was finding about the calculus of variations spent more time with examples of its usage rather than defining the concept itself. I also began taking some notes on the article <em>An Efficient Overloaded Method for Computing Derivatives of Mathematical Functions in MATLAB</em> to get a base of knowledge on computational derivatives. To further gain information on automatic derivatives I found the site <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/"
target="_blank">www.autodiff.org</a> that is a central hub for automatic differentiation information. The site contains lists of articles and books that have dealt with the topic of automatic differentiation along with links to different tools that use automatic differentiation in different programming languages. From this web site I have found the article <em>An Introduction to Automatic Differentiation</em> from which I plan to read and take notes over.</p>
