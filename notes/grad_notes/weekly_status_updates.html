<h3 id="week-10312015---1162015">Week 10/31/2015 - 11/6/2015</h3>
<p>I have not spent time with Ipopt this week but have instead began reading from the book <em>Introduction to Numerical Analysis</em> by Stoer and Bulirsch. I am looking into numerical integrations techniques which is the content of Chapter 3. I found that the first integration technique discussed (Newton-Cotes formulas) refered back to lagrange interpolation which is the first topic in chapter 2 and so I backtracked and read through this section. I then coded up a function in Python that uses the lagrange interpolation and tested it on the normal bell curve function. (The normal distribution/bell curve is used as the example function for the other coded examples as I learn numerical integration due to it being a more complex function than a simple polynomial but still having very widely known integral values for standard deviations.) After I coded up the interpolation function I returned to Chapter 3 where I re-read and took hand written notes. I finished the week by coding Sampson's Rule for integration in Python and doing a quick reading over the sections in chapter 3 that deal with error estimates. I have not taken any electronic notes over these sections.</p>

<p>This week was spent finishing the C tutorial series that I had found on youtube (<a
href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq"
target="_blank">link</a>). After finishing the tutorial series I began looking at the Ipopt example for C programming. Still having a bit of trouble figuring out how to get the ipopt library to link to the example code. I also attempted getting Ipopt installed on my Mac laptop to uncertain success.</p>

<p>During this week I continued watching tutorials on programming in C. I also continued doing some practice with programming in C alongside the tutorials. In additiona I took some time to look at the differences between C and C++. Lastly I spent some time this week to catch up on writing weekly status reports.</p>

<p>This week I have had another change in direction of research. My project is now looking to be implementiing the lab's GPOPS II software in a compilable language such as C or C++ for portability and cost reasons. Due to this shift I have started watching tutorials over programming in C. I also invested time into getting IPOPT on my computer. IPOPT is a nonlinear programming problem solver and will eventually be needed for the project. Lastly I have set up a git repo to contain my graduate work and have started practicing programming in C.</p>

<h3 id="week-9262015---1022015">Week 9/26/2015 - 10/2/2015</h3>
<p>This week started off by finishing the notes I was taking on chapter 4 section 1 of <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em>. I have begun taking notes over the next section which starts to introduce the optimalitiy conditions of constrained problems. Most of my note taking time in this section so far is translating the math notation into words so that I can understand what it is that they are presenting. I have yet to finish this section and looking at the size of this section it will take a lot of time to complete.</p>

<p>This week I started off continuing notes in chapter 2 section 3 but I then jumped to chapter 4 which covers optimality conditions at the recommendation of Dr. Rao. I have read chapter 4 section 1 which deals with optimality conditions of unconstrained problems. I have spent the rest of the time this week going back through chapter 4 section 1 taking notes and trying to improve my understanding of its content. One problem that I have been encountering is that the chapter keeps refering back to chapter 3 theorems and material that I have not yet learned, however, I am making progress on understanding the optimality conditions and should be able to move forward to the next section soon.</p>

<p>This week I continued making progress through the book <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> by Bazaraa. I was able to finish taking notes over chapter 2 section 1 which covered convex sets and convex hulls. I have also completely read and taken notes over chapter 2 section 2. This section had a multitude of set definitions in it including neighborhood of a point, set closure, interior of a set, set boundaries and compact sets. I have also spent some time reading the mathematical review of sets and sequences presented in appendix A.3 of the book in order to further my understanding of chapter 2 section 2. I have read chapter 2 section 3 and am currently in the process of taking notes over that section, however, I have had to spend more time in the mathematical review in the appendix in order to aid in comprehension of the chapter 2 section 3 material.</p>

<p>This week time was spent exclusively working with the book <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> by Bazaraa. Over the course of the week I have completely read chapter 1 of this book which deals with the format of nonlinear programming problems and have taken notes over that chapter. I have also read through chapter 2 section 1 which covers convex sets and convex hulls and am currently taking notes over this section.</p>

<p>This week I started off reading the article <em>An Introduction to Automatic Differentiation</em>. After I finished reading the article I went back and started to take notes over the details of the article in order to gain a better understanding. During this note taking I differentiated a fucntion I made up using the automatic differentiation method described in the article. Also while taking notes I added information on Hessian matrices to my general notes page. About part way through the week Dr. Rao mentioned that I could maybe do a project involving writing a new non-linear programming problem solver and so I did a bit of research on NLP solvers. While serching for information I found more comparisons of current NLP solvers than research articles involving what a NLP solver is and how they are improved. Dr. Rao then lent me 3 text books to start reading: <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> by Bazaraa, <em>Practical Methods of Optimization</em> by Fletcher and <em>Nonlinear Programming</em> by Bertsekas. I have begun reading and taking notes over <em>Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms</em> and plan to continue doing so for the forseeable future.</p>

<h3 id="week-8212015---8282015">Week 8/21/2015 - 8/28/2015</h3>
<p>This week I started by taking general optimal control notes from the article <em>Faster, Higher and Greener</em> to better understand controls terminology. I also took some general notes over the control Hamiltonian and Calculus of Variations. For the calculus of variations notes I found an article, <em>Introduction to the Calculus of Variations</em>, of which I read a portion. A lot of the articles I was finding about the calculus of variations spent more time with examples of its usage rather than defining the concept itself. I also began taking some notes on the article <em>An Efficient Overloaded Method for Computing Derivatives of Mathematical Functions in MATLAB</em> to get a base of knowledge on computational derivatives. To further gain information on automatic derivatives I found the site <a href="http://www.autodiff.org/"
target="_blank">www.autodiff.org</a> that is a central hub for automatic differentiation information. The site contains lists of articles and books that have dealt with the topic of automatic differentiation along with links to different tools that use automatic differentiation in different programming languages. From this web site I have found the article <em>An Introduction to Automatic Differentiation</em> from which I plan to read and take notes over.</p>
