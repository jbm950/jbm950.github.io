Method for cleaning heliostats
    - Combine columb force cleaning with scrubbing
        - "Scrubbing is typically five times slower than spraying, but requires
          half the water"
            - Would this be able to increase cleaning speed?
            - Scrubbing uses less water than spraying and removes dirt film where spraying only removes dust

Wording in sylabus:
    The final report will be based on a relevant topic of the studentâ€™s choice,
    pending the approval of Prof. Scheffe. For undergraduates, the report will
    be a 4000 word critical literature review of the selected technology and an
    analysis of its potential for large scale (centralized or distributed) and
    economical distribution. For graduate students, the report will be in the
    form of a 5000 word research proposal; students will propose to investigate
    a selected topic, propose why they believe the work is relevant, provide
    justification in the form of preliminary analysis and specifically discuss
    what they would do to achieve their stated goals (either experimentation,
    computation or both).

Notes:
    - Cant find Kattke and Vant Hull info aon the optimization of scrubbing vs
      spraying for heliostats
