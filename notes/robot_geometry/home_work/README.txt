To run the code you'll need a python interpreter. For simplicity I suggest 
downloading the Anaconda package as it comes with numpy already which will also 
be needed to run the code. A link to download the package is given as follows.

Be sure to download the python3 distribution and not the python2 distribution of
 Anaconda.

Next a common Python IDE is pycharm. A link to this IDE is given as follows.

I downloaded the community one and got it working so either distribution of 
Pycharm should be ok.

Now you'll possibly need to link pycharm to the anaconda distribution. This can 
be done in Pycharm by going to File/Settings/Project/Project Interpreter and 
clicking the little settings wheel at the top right by Project Interpreter. Now 
select add local, navigate to the anaconda folder you installed and select 
python.exe inside the anaconda folder. 

After pycharm fully loads the anaconda distribution you can run the code using 
the run tab at the top of the screen.

I appologize for the number of steps to run my project but I think this will be 
the quickest way to get python up and running.
